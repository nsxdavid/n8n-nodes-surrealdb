# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up the GitHub repository for the n8n-nodes-surrealdb project.

## Steps to Set Up the GitHub Repository

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
   - Name: `n8n-nodes-surrealdb`
   - Description: "n8n community node for SurrealDB"
   - Visibility: Public
   - Initialize with README: No (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push Your Local Repository to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Add the GitHub repository as remote
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-nodes-surrealdb.git

   # Push your code to GitHub
   git push -u origin refactor/table-resource
   ```

3. **Set Up GitHub Repository Features**
   - Enable Issues for bug reports and feature requests
   - Set up issue templates (optional)
   - Enable Discussions for community engagement (optional)
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)

4. **Create a Release**
   - Once your code is ready for release:
     ```bash
     git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
     git push origin v0.1.0
     ```
   - Go to the "Releases" section on GitHub and create a release from this tag
   - Add detailed release notes

5. **Update Repository Information in package.json**
   - Make sure the repository URL in package.json points to your GitHub repository

## GitHub Repository Best Practices

1. **Keep the README Updated**
   - Make sure the README always reflects the current state of the project
   - Include screenshots of the node in action

2. **Respond to Issues and Pull Requests**
   - Set up notifications for repository activity
   - Respond to issues and pull requests in a timely manner

3. **Use Semantic Versioning**
   - Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for releases
   - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format

4. **Document Changes**
   - Keep a CHANGELOG.md file updated with all notable changes

## After GitHub Setup

Once your GitHub repository is set up, you can proceed with:

1. Sharing the repository with the n8n community
2. Publishing the package to npm (see NPM_PUBLISHING.md)
3. Gathering feedback and making improvements
