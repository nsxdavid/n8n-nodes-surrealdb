- Use files in memory-bank to keep track of progress and state (use Cline memory-bank approach)
- Use 'npm run build' to check for errors
- Always do a build before asking for a test
- When code is able to be tested (even if partially complete) stop and ask user to perform a test with details about expected results. Only the user runs tests (because this is n8n)
- Never consider anything done until it passes user testing. Don't mark off progress or suggest a commit until then.
