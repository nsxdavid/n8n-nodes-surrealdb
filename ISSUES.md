## 7. Response Transformation Issues

**General Issue**: Many operations transform SurrealDB's response data instead of returning it directly, adding unnecessary properties, custom messages, or restructuring the data.

**Principles for Refactoring**:
1. Return SurrealDB's data in its native format without transformation
2. Don't add "user-friendly" properties or restructure responses
3. Let SurrealDB's API design shine through our integration
4. Keep our code simple and focused on facilitating the interaction, not reimagining it
5. Ensure future compatibility by not making assumptions about response structures

**Remember**: We are providing a layer to allow n8n to interact with SurrealDB. We respect how SurrealDB does things.
