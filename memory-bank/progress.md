# Progress: n8n-nodes-surrealdb

## Current Status

The SurrealDB node is in a functional state with most of the core features implemented according to the PRD requirements. Recent improvements have focused on standardizing query handling for different authentication types and enhancing error handling.

### What Works

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Connection to SurrealDB instances (local, remote, cloud)
   - Authentication with username/password
   - Namespace and database selection
   - Connection closure in finally block

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Query: Execute raw SurrealQL queries
   - Create: Create records in a table
   - Update: Update records in a table
   - Select: Retrieve records from a table
   - Delete: Delete records from a table

3. **Credential Management**:
   - Support for connection string or individual parameters
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Credential testing functionality

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Error messages could be more descriptive and consistent across operations
   - Some edge cases may not be handled properly
   - Error recovery mechanisms could be improved

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Field labels and placeholders could be more descriptive and helpful
   - Display options could be enhanced for better UX
   - Advanced options could be better organized

### What's Left to Build

1. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Implement more descriptive error messages for specific error scenarios
   - Add better handling for network errors and connection issues
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms

2. **Additional Table Operations**:
   - **Update All Records**: Operation to update all records in a table with the same data
   - **Delete All Records**: Operation to delete all records in a table (with confirmation)
   - **Merge All Records**: Operation to merge the same data into all records in a table
   - Add appropriate safeguards and clear documentation about the impact of these operations

3. **UI Refinements**:
   - Add more descriptive field labels and helpful placeholders
   - Improve field descriptions with examples
   - Enhance display options for better user experience

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update inline code documentation
   - Create comprehensive usage examples
   - Document edge cases and best practices
   - Add developer documentation for future maintenance

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Implementation

The initial implementation focused on basic connectivity and core operations:

1. **Connection Management**: Implemented connection to SurrealDB with authentication and namespace/database selection.
2. **Basic Operations**: Implemented query, create, update, select, and delete operations.
3. **Credential Management**: Added support for connection string or individual parameters.

### Current Refactoring Plan

Based on the PRD requirements, a comprehensive refactoring plan has been developed:

1. **Phase 1: Preparation and Infrastructure**
   - Create utility functions for RecordId handling, input validation, and output transformation

2. **Phase 2: Resource-Based Restructuring**
   - Implement Record, Table, Query, and System resource operations

3. **Phase 3: UI and UX Improvements**
   - Update node properties and enhance error handling

4. **Phase 4: Final Testing and Documentation**
   - Comprehensive testing and documentation updates

This plan provides a structured approach to updating the node while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.

## Known Issues

1. **RecordId Handling**: The current implementation uses string concatenation for record IDs rather than the RecordId class from the SurrealDB SDK, which may cause issues with some operations.

2. **Cloud vs. Self-hosted**: There may be differences in how cloud and self-hosted instances of SurrealDB handle connections and authentication.

3. **Error Handling**: Some error scenarios may not be handled properly, leading to unclear error messages.

## Next Milestone

Phase 2 of the refactoring plan has been completed:

1. **Implement Record Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Create Record operation (refactored existing create)
   - Added Get Record operation to retrieve a specific record by ID
   - Added Update Record operation (refactored existing update)
   - Added Merge Record operation to merge data into a specific record
   - Added Delete Record operation (refactored existing delete)
   - Added Upsert Record operation to create or update a record
   - All operations implemented with proper validation and error handling

2. **Implement Table Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Get All Records operation (refactored existing select) with pagination
   - Added Create Many operation to create multiple records in a single operation
   - Added Get Many operation to retrieve multiple specific records by their IDs
   - All operations implemented with proper validation and error handling

3. **Implement Query Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Refactored existing query operation
   - Added pagination support with LIMIT and START parameters
   - Improved array result handling to properly return multiple items
   - Enhanced parameter handling with validation

4. **Implement System Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Health Check operation using n8n's httpRequest helper
   - Added Version operation with fallback mechanism:
     - First tries using `db.query('INFO FOR SERVER')`
     - Falls back to the /version endpoint if needed
   - Both operations implemented with proper error handling
   - System operations do not throw errors on failure, but return a status indicating success or failure

The credentials rewrite has been completed successfully:

1. **Credentials Rewrite (Completed)**:
    * Implemented support for only HTTP/HTTPS protocols in the connection string
    * Defined all required fields with appropriate visibility rules:
        * `connectionString`: Required, with examples and validation
        * `authentication`: Required, with options for Root, Namespace, and Database
        * `username` and `password`: Required for authentication
        * `namespace`: Optional, hidden for Root authentication
        * `database`: Optional, hidden for Root and Namespace authentication
    * Implemented standard n8n credential testing method
    * Updated connection functions to work with the new credential structure

The next milestone is to continue with Phase 3 of the original refactoring plan: UI and UX Improvements, focusing on enhancing error handling across all operations in `SurrealDb.node.ts`.

## Recent Improvements

### Bug Fixes and Testing
1. **Fixed Table Operations**:
   - Debugged and fixed the `getAllRecords` operation to correctly process results from `client.query`
   - Debugged and fixed the `createMany` operation to use `client.insert()` instead of an incorrect `client.query()` call
   - Debugged and fixed the `getMany` operation, confirming that interpolating Record IDs directly into the `WHERE id IN [...]` clause is the correct approach
   - Confirmed `getAllRecords`, `createMany`, `getMany`, `executeQuery`, and `version` operations are working correctly after fixes

2. **Added Namespace/Database Overrides**:
   - Implemented optional Namespace and Database overrides in the UI
   - Added fields to allow users to specify a Namespace and Database for an operation, overriding the credential settings
   - Updated `SurrealDbProperties.ts`, `SurrealDb.node.ts`, and `GenericFunctions.ts` to support these overrides
   - Moved the "Advanced Options" block containing these fields to the end of the node properties list for better UI layout

### Standardized Query Handling for Authentication Types

A significant improvement has been implemented to standardize query handling across different SurrealDB authentication types:

1. **Added `prepareSurrealQuery` Utility Function**:
   - Created a new utility function in GenericFunctions.ts that modifies queries based on authentication type
   - For Root authentication: Adds both namespace and database to queries (`USE NS namespace DB database; query`)
   - For Namespace authentication: Adds database to queries (`USE DB database; query`)
   - For Database authentication: No modification needed (passes query through unchanged)

2. **Updated All Query Operations**:
   - Modified Table >> Get All Records to use the new utility function
   - Modified Table >> Get Many to use the new utility function
   - Modified Query >> Execute Query to use the new utility function
   - Modified System >> Version to use the new utility function for INFO FOR SERVER query

3. **Improved Connection String Handling**:
   - Enhanced connection string formatting in connectSurrealClient to ensure proper /rpc endpoint handling
   - Added logic to remove trailing slashes and add /rpc for HTTP/HTTPS connections
   - Updated credential test to handle /rpc endpoint correctly

4. **Added Conditional Debug Logging**:
   - Implemented a DEBUG flag at the top of SurrealDb.node.ts that can be toggled to enable/disable debug logging
   - Added conditional debug logging statements throughout the code to help with troubleshooting
   - Log statements include original query, modified query, authentication details, and result structure

5. **Enhanced Result Processing**:
   - Improved handling of query results, especially for queries with USE statements
   - Added logic to find the first non-null array in the result for queries that include USE statements
   - Updated result formatting to handle different result structures consistently

### UI Improvements

1. **Consolidated Options and Advanced Options**:
   - Removed the standalone "Advanced Options" collection from `SurrealDbProperties.ts`
   - Added namespace/database fields to each resource-specific "Options" collection
   - Created new "Options" collections for resources that didn't have them (Record, System, and Table operations)
   - Updated `SurrealDb.node.ts` to retrieve namespace/database overrides from the consolidated "Options" parameter
   - This change simplifies the UI by reducing the number of dropdowns while maintaining all functionality

2. **Improved Field Descriptions**:
   - Updated the descriptions for Table and Record ID fields to accurately reflect how the table extraction from record IDs works
   - Clarified that the table prefix in a record ID (e.g., "person:john") is only used if the Table field is empty, rather than overriding it
   - Made it clear that any table field can accept a full record ID format (e.g., "person:john") and the table part will be automatically extracted
   - Verified that the implementations in the code match these descriptions
   - These changes make the node's behavior more predictable and easier to understand for users working with SurrealDB records

These improvements make the node more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly by centralizing the authentication-specific logic in one utility function and simplifying the UI, following the DRY principle.
