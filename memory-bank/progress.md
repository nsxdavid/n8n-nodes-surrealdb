# Progress: n8n-nodes-surrealdb

## Current Status

The SurrealDB node is in a functional state with most of the core features implemented according to the PRD requirements. Recent improvements have focused on standardizing query handling for different authentication types and enhancing error handling.

### What Works

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Connection to SurrealDB instances (local, remote, cloud)
   - Authentication with username/password
   - Namespace and database selection
   - Connection closure in finally block

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Query: Execute raw SurrealQL queries
   - Create: Create records in a table
   - Update: Update records in a table
   - Select: Retrieve records from a table
   - Delete: Delete records from a table

3. **Credential Management**:
   - Support for connection string or individual parameters
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Credential testing functionality

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Credentials Implementation**: The current credential implementation is complex and has proven difficult to refactor incrementally. It needs to be rewritten from scratch based on precise, simplified requirements to support standard n8n credential testing.

2. **Resource Organization**:
   - Operations are not organized by resources (Record, Table, Query, System)
   - UI doesn't reflect the resource-based structure

3. **Operation Implementation**:
   - Some operations are missing (Get Record, Merge, Upsert, etc.)
   - Existing operations don't fully align with PRD specifications

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Limited validation for input fields
   - Inconsistent error messages

5. **Output Transformation**:
   - Inconsistent output formatting across operations
   - Array results handling could be improved

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Error messages could be more descriptive
   - Some edge cases may not be handled properly

### What's Left to Build

1. **Credentials Rewrite**: Rewrite the credential definition and handling logic from scratch to simplify it and align with standard n8n credential testing.

2. **Record Resource Operations**:
   - Get: Retrieve a specific record by ID
   - Merge: Merge data into a specific record
   - Upsert: Create or update a record

3. **Table Resource Operations**:
   - Get All Records: Retrieve all records with pagination
   - Create Many: Create multiple records in a single operation
   - Get Many: Retrieve multiple specific records by their IDs

4. **Query Resource Enhancements**:
   - Add pagination support
   - Improve parameter handling

5. **System Resource Operations**:
   - Health Check: Check if the database instance is responsive
   - Version: Get the version of the SurrealDB instance

6. **UI Improvements**:
   - Reorganize properties to match the resource-based structure
   - Update display options for better UX
   - Add more descriptive field labels and placeholders

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Implementation

The initial implementation focused on basic connectivity and core operations:

1. **Connection Management**: Implemented connection to SurrealDB with authentication and namespace/database selection.
2. **Basic Operations**: Implemented query, create, update, select, and delete operations.
3. **Credential Management**: Added support for connection string or individual parameters.

### Current Refactoring Plan

Based on the PRD requirements, a comprehensive refactoring plan has been developed:

1. **Phase 1: Preparation and Infrastructure**
   - Create utility functions for RecordId handling, input validation, and output transformation

2. **Phase 2: Resource-Based Restructuring**
   - Implement Record, Table, Query, and System resource operations

3. **Phase 3: UI and UX Improvements**
   - Update node properties and enhance error handling

4. **Phase 4: Final Testing and Documentation**
   - Comprehensive testing and documentation updates

This plan provides a structured approach to updating the node while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.

## Known Issues

1. **RecordId Handling**: The current implementation doesn't use the RecordId class from the SurrealDB SDK, which may cause issues with some operations.

2. **Cloud vs. Self-hosted**: There may be differences in how cloud and self-hosted instances of SurrealDB handle connections and authentication.

3. **Error Handling**: Some error scenarios may not be handled properly, leading to unclear error messages.

4. **Output Formatting**: Output formatting is inconsistent across operations, which may cause confusion for users.

5. **Input Validation**: Limited validation for input fields may allow invalid inputs, leading to runtime errors.

## Next Milestone

Phase 2 of the refactoring plan has been completed:

1. **Implement Record Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Create Record operation (refactored existing create)
   - Added Get Record operation to retrieve a specific record by ID
   - Added Update Record operation (refactored existing update)
   - Added Merge Record operation to merge data into a specific record
   - Added Delete Record operation (refactored existing delete)
   - Added Upsert Record operation to create or update a record
   - All operations implemented with proper validation and error handling

2. **Implement Table Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Get All Records operation (refactored existing select) with pagination
   - Added Create Many operation to create multiple records in a single operation
   - Added Get Many operation to retrieve multiple specific records by their IDs
   - All operations implemented with proper validation and error handling

3. **Implement Query Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Refactored existing query operation
   - Added pagination support with LIMIT and START parameters
   - Improved array result handling to properly return multiple items
   - Enhanced parameter handling with validation

4. **Implement System Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Health Check operation using n8n's httpRequest helper
   - Added Version operation with fallback mechanism:
     - First tries using `db.query('INFO FOR SERVER')`
     - Falls back to the /version endpoint if needed
   - Both operations implemented with proper error handling
   - System operations do not throw errors on failure, but return a status indicating success or failure

The next milestone is to rewrite the credentials part of the node from scratch based on the following precise, simplified requirements:

1. **Rewrite Credentials**:
    *   **Supported Protocols:** ONLY `http://` and `https://` for the `connectionString`. No WebSocket support.
    *   **Fields:**
        1.  `connectionString`: (Type: string, Required) Example: `https://localhost:8000` or `https://<cloud-id>.surreal.cloud`. Must start with `http://` or `https://`.
        2.  `authentication`: (Type: options - 'Root', 'Namespace', 'Database', Required) Determines the scope of authentication.
        3.  `username`: (Type: string, Required) User for authentication.
        4.  `password`: (Type: string, Password input type, Required) Password for authentication.
        5.  `namespace`: (Type: string, Optional) The target namespace.
            *   **Visibility:** Hidden if `authentication` is set to 'Root'.
        6.  `database`: (Type: string, Optional) The target database.
            *   **Visibility:** Hidden if `authentication` is set to 'Root' or 'Namespace'.
    *   **Testing:** Must use the standard n8n credential `test` method for connection verification.

Following the credentials rewrite, the next steps will be to continue with Phase 3 of the original refactoring plan: UI and UX Improvements, starting with enhancing error handling.

## Recent Improvements

### Standardized Query Handling for Authentication Types

A significant improvement has been implemented to standardize query handling across different SurrealDB authentication types:

1. **Added `prepareSurrealQuery` Utility Function**:
   - Created a new utility function in GenericFunctions.ts that modifies queries based on authentication type
   - For Root authentication: Adds both namespace and database to queries (`USE NS namespace DB database; query`)
   - For Namespace authentication: Adds database to queries (`USE DB database; query`)
   - For Database authentication: No modification needed (passes query through unchanged)

2. **Updated All Query Operations**:
   - Modified Table >> Get All Records to use the new utility function
   - Modified Table >> Get Many to use the new utility function
   - Modified Query >> Execute Query to use the new utility function
   - Modified System >> Version to use the new utility function for INFO FOR SERVER query

3. **Improved Connection String Handling**:
   - Enhanced connection string formatting in connectSurrealClient to ensure proper /rpc endpoint handling
   - Added logic to remove trailing slashes and add /rpc for HTTP/HTTPS connections
   - Updated credential test to handle /rpc endpoint correctly

4. **Added Conditional Debug Logging**:
   - Implemented a DEBUG flag at the top of SurrealDb.node.ts that can be toggled to enable/disable debug logging
   - Added conditional debug logging statements throughout the code to help with troubleshooting
   - Log statements include original query, modified query, authentication details, and result structure

5. **Enhanced Result Processing**:
   - Improved handling of query results, especially for queries with USE statements
   - Added logic to find the first non-null array in the result for queries that include USE statements
   - Updated result formatting to handle different result structures consistently

These improvements make the node more robust and maintainable by centralizing the authentication-specific logic in one utility function, following the DRY principle.
