# Progress: n8n-nodes-surrealdb

## Current Status

The SurrealDB node is in a functional state with most of the core features implemented according to the PRD requirements. Recent improvements have focused on standardizing query handling for different authentication types and enhancing error handling. The next major focus is implementing schema management operations for Tables, Fields, and Indexes, and operations for the new "Relations" resource.

### What Works

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Connection to SurrealDB instances (local, remote, cloud)
   - Authentication with username/password
   - Namespace and database selection
   - Connection closure in finally block

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Query: Execute raw SurrealQL queries
   - Create: Create records in a table
   - Update: Update records in a table
   - Select: Retrieve records from a table
   - Delete: Delete records from a table

3. **Credential Management**:
   - Support for connection string or individual parameters
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Credential testing functionality

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Error messages could be more descriptive and consistent across operations
   - Some edge cases may not be handled properly
   - Error recovery mechanisms could be improved

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Field labels and placeholders could be more descriptive and helpful
   - Display options could be enhanced for better UX
   - Advanced options could be better organized

### What's Left to Build

1. **Schema Management Operations**:
    *   **Table Resource**:
        *   `Create Table`
        *   `Drop Table`
        *   `List Tables`
        *   `Describe Table`
        *   `Create Field`
        *   `Drop Field`
        *   `List Fields`
        *   `Describe Field`
    *   **Index Resource**:
        *   `Create Index`
        *   `Drop Index`
        *   `List Indexes`
        *   `Describe Index`

2. **Relations Resource Operations**:
    *   **Relations Resource**:
        *   `Create Relationship`
        *   `Delete Relationship`
        *   `Select Relationships`

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Implement more descriptive error messages for specific error scenarios
   - Add better handling for network errors and connection issues
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms

4. **Additional Table Operations**:
   - **Update All Records**: Operation to update all records in a table with the same data
   - **Delete All Records**: Operation to delete all records in a table (with confirmation)
   - **Merge All Records**: Operation to merge the same data into all records in a table
   - Add appropriate safeguards and clear documentation about the impact of these operations

5. **UI Refinements**:
   - Add more descriptive field labels and helpful placeholders
   - Improve field descriptions with examples
   - Enhance display options for better user experience

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update inline code documentation
   - Create comprehensive usage examples
   - Document edge cases and best practices
   - Add developer documentation for future maintenance

7. **Scope Operations**: (Postponed for a later phase)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Implementation

The initial implementation focused on basic connectivity and core operations:

1. **Connection Management**: Implemented connection to SurrealDB with authentication and namespace/database selection.
2. **Basic Operations**: Implemented query, create, update, select, and delete operations.
3. **Credential Management**: Added support for connection string or individual parameters.

### Current Refactoring Plan

Based on the PRD requirements, a comprehensive refactoring plan has been developed:

1. **Phase 1: Preparation and Infrastructure**
   - Create utility functions for RecordId handling, input validation, and output transformation

2. **Phase 2: Resource-Based Restructuring**
   - Implement Record, Table, Query, and System resource operations

3. **Phase 3: UI and UX Improvements**
   - Update node properties and enhance error handling

4. **Phase 4: Final Testing and Documentation**
   - Comprehensive testing and documentation updates

This plan provides a structured approach to updating the node while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality. The plan has been updated to include schema management and relations operations.

## Known Issues

1. **RecordId Handling**: The current implementation uses string concatenation for record IDs rather than the RecordId class from the SurrealDB SDK, which may cause issues with some operations.

2. **Cloud vs. Self-hosted**: There may be differences in how cloud and self-hosted instances of SurrealDB handle connections and authentication.

3. **Error Handling**: Some error scenarios may not be handled properly, leading to unclear error messages.

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to implement the planned schema management operations for Tables, Fields, and Indexes, the "Relations" resource operations, and continue with Phase 3 of the original refactoring plan, focusing on enhancing error handling.

## Recent Improvements

### Refactoring Progress
1. **Completed Modular Architecture Refactoring**:
   - Implemented a complete resource-based modular architecture
   - Refactored System, Query, Record, and Table resources into separate modules
   - Created IOperationHandler interface for standardized operation handling
   - Moved UI properties into resource-specific files
   - All tests pass with the new refactored architecture

### Bug Fixes and Testing
1. **Fixed Table Operations**:
   - Debugged and fixed the `getAllRecords` operation to correctly process results from `client.query`
   - Debugged and fixed the `createMany` operation to use `client.insert()` instead of an incorrect `client.query()` call.
   - Debugged and fixed the `getMany` operation, confirming that interpolating Record IDs directly into the `WHERE id IN [...]` clause is the correct approach.
   - Confirmed `getAllRecords`, `createMany`, `getMany`, `executeQuery`, and `version` operations are working correctly after fixes.

2. **Added Namespace/Database Overrides**:
   - Implemented optional Namespace and Database overrides in the UI
   - Added fields to allow users to specify a Namespace and Database for an operation, overriding the credential settings
   - Updated `SurrealDbProperties.ts`, `SurrealDb.node.ts`, and `GenericFunctions.ts` to support these overrides
   - Moved the "Advanced Options" block containing these fields to the end of the node properties list for better UI layout.

### Standardized Query Handling for Authentication Types

A significant improvement has been implemented to standardize query handling across different SurrealDB authentication types:

1. **Added `prepareSurrealQuery` Utility Function**:
   - Created a new utility function in GenericFunctions.ts that modifies queries based on authentication type
   - For Root authentication: Adds both namespace and database to queries (`USE NS namespace DB database; query`)
   - For Namespace authentication: Adds database to queries (`USE DB database; query`)
   - For Database authentication: No modification needed (passes query through unchanged)

2. **Updated All Query Operations**:
   - Modified Table >> Get All Records to use the new utility function
   - Modified Table >> Get Many to use the new utility function
   - Modified Query >> Execute Query to use the new utility function
   - Modified System >> Version to use the new utility function for INFO FOR SERVER query

3. **Improved Connection String Handling**:
   - Enhanced connection string formatting in connectSurrealClient to ensure proper /rpc endpoint handling
   - Added logic to remove trailing slashes and add /rpc for HTTP/HTTPS connections
   - Updated credential test to handle /rpc endpoint correctly

4. **Added Conditional Debug Logging**:
   - Implemented a DEBUG flag at the top of SurrealDb.node.ts that can be toggled to enable/disable debug logging
   - Added conditional debug logging statements throughout the code to help with troubleshooting
   - Log statements include original query, modified query, authentication details, and result structure

5. **Enhanced Result Processing**:
   - Improved handling of query results, especially for queries with USE statements
   - Added logic to find the first non-null array in the result for queries that include USE statements
   - Updated result formatting to handle different result structures consistently

### UI Improvements

1. **Consolidated Options and Advanced Options**:
   - Removed the standalone "Advanced Options" collection from `SurrealDbProperties.ts`
   - Added namespace/database fields to each resource-specific "Options" collection
   - Created new "Options" collections for resources that didn't have them (Record, System, and Table operations)
   - Updated `SurrealDb.node.ts` to retrieve namespace/database overrides from the consolidated "Options" parameter
   - This change simplifies the UI by reducing the number of dropdowns while maintaining all functionality

2. **Improved Field Descriptions**:
   - Updated the descriptions for Table and Record ID fields to accurately reflect how the table extraction from record IDs works
   - Clarified that the table prefix in a record ID (e.g., "person:john") is only used if the Table field is empty, rather than overriding it
   - Made it clear that any table field can accept a full record ID format (e.g., "person:john") and the table part will be automatically extracted
   - Verified that the implementations in the code match these descriptions
   - These changes make the node's behavior more predictable and easier to understand for users working with SurrealDB records

These improvements make the node more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly by centralizing the authentication-specific logic in one utility function and simplifying the UI, following the DRY principle.
