# Progress: n8n-nodes-surrealdb

## Current Status

The SurrealDB node is currently in a partially functional state. It provides basic connectivity to SurrealDB and implements some core operations, but it needs significant refactoring to align with the requirements specified in the PRD.

### What Works

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Connection to SurrealDB instances (local, remote, cloud)
   - Authentication with username/password
   - Namespace and database selection
   - Connection closure in finally block

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Query: Execute raw SurrealQL queries
   - Create: Create records in a table
   - Update: Update records in a table
   - Select: Retrieve records from a table
   - Delete: Delete records from a table

3. **Credential Management**:
   - Support for connection string or individual parameters
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Credential testing functionality

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Resource Organization**:
   - Operations are not organized by resources (Record, Table, Query, System)
   - UI doesn't reflect the resource-based structure

2. **Operation Implementation**:
   - Some operations are missing (Get Record, Merge, Upsert, etc.)
   - Existing operations don't fully align with PRD specifications

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Limited validation for input fields
   - Inconsistent error messages

4. **Output Transformation**:
   - Inconsistent output formatting across operations
   - Array results handling could be improved

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Error messages could be more descriptive
   - Some edge cases may not be handled properly

### What's Left to Build

1. **Record Resource Operations**:
   - Get: Retrieve a specific record by ID
   - Merge: Merge data into a specific record
   - Upsert: Create or update a record

2. **Table Resource Operations**:
   - Get All Records: Retrieve all records with pagination
   - Create Many: Create multiple records in a single operation
   - Get Many: Retrieve multiple specific records by their IDs

3. **Query Resource Enhancements**:
   - Add pagination support
   - Improve parameter handling

4. **System Resource Operations**:
   - Health Check: Check if the database instance is responsive
   - Version: Get the version of the SurrealDB instance

5. **UI Improvements**:
   - Reorganize properties to match the resource-based structure
   - Update display options for better UX
   - Add more descriptive field labels and placeholders

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Implementation

The initial implementation focused on basic connectivity and core operations:

1. **Connection Management**: Implemented connection to SurrealDB with authentication and namespace/database selection.
2. **Basic Operations**: Implemented query, create, update, select, and delete operations.
3. **Credential Management**: Added support for connection string or individual parameters.

### Current Refactoring Plan

Based on the PRD requirements, a comprehensive refactoring plan has been developed:

1. **Phase 1: Preparation and Infrastructure**
   - Create utility functions for RecordId handling, input validation, and output transformation

2. **Phase 2: Resource-Based Restructuring**
   - Implement Record, Table, Query, and System resource operations

3. **Phase 3: UI and UX Improvements**
   - Update node properties and enhance error handling

4. **Phase 4: Final Testing and Documentation**
   - Comprehensive testing and documentation updates

This plan provides a structured approach to updating the node while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.

## Known Issues

1. **RecordId Handling**: The current implementation doesn't use the RecordId class from the SurrealDB SDK, which may cause issues with some operations.

2. **Cloud vs. Self-hosted**: There may be differences in how cloud and self-hosted instances of SurrealDB handle connections and authentication.

3. **Error Handling**: Some error scenarios may not be handled properly, leading to unclear error messages.

4. **Output Formatting**: Output formatting is inconsistent across operations, which may cause confusion for users.

5. **Input Validation**: Limited validation for input fields may allow invalid inputs, leading to runtime errors.

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to complete Phase 1 of the refactoring plan:

1. **Create RecordId Utility Function**
   - Add a utility function to handle the creation of RecordId objects
   - Test with existing operations to ensure compatibility

2. **Enhance Input Validation**
   - Add JSON validation functions
   - Add required field validation functions
   - Add type validation functions
   - Test with existing operations

3. **Standardize Output Transformation**
   - Create helper functions for consistent output formatting
   - Test with existing operations

This will lay the foundation for the resource-based restructuring in Phase 2.
