# Product Context: n8n-nodes-surrealdb

## Why This Project Exists

The n8n-nodes-surrealdb project exists to bridge the gap between n8n automation workflows and SurrealDB databases. SurrealDB is a powerful, cloud-native NewSQL database that offers unique capabilities like nested document storage, graph relationships, and a flexible query language. By creating a dedicated n8n node for SurrealDB, we enable n8n users to leverage these capabilities in their automation workflows without having to resort to custom code or HTTP requests.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Database Integration**: Provides a direct, native integration between n8n and SurrealDB, eliminating the need for custom code or complex HTTP request nodes.

2. **Simplified Database Operations**: Abstracts the complexity of SurrealDB operations into a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of database expertise.

3. **Standardized Output Formatting**: Ensures consistent output formatting for all database operations, making it easier to use the results in subsequent workflow steps.

4. **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling with descriptive error messages, helping users troubleshoot issues more effectively.

5. **Authentication Management**: Handles authentication securely, allowing users to store their SurrealDB credentials safely within n8n.

## How It Should Work

The node should provide a seamless experience for n8n users:

1. **Connection Setup**: Users configure their SurrealDB connection once through n8n's credential system.

2. **Operation Selection**: Users select the desired operation from a categorized list (Record, Table, Query, System).

3. **Parameter Configuration**: The node presents relevant fields based on the selected operation, with clear labels and helpful descriptions.

4. **Execution**: The node executes the operation against the SurrealDB instance, handling authentication and connection management automatically.

5. **Result Processing**: Results are formatted consistently according to n8n conventions, ready to be used in subsequent workflow steps.

6. **Error Handling**: If an error occurs, the node provides a clear, actionable error message to help the user resolve the issue.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Interface**: The node should present a clear, intuitive interface that follows n8n conventions and makes it easy to find and configure operations.

2. **Minimal Friction**: Users should be able to perform common database operations with minimal configuration and without needing to understand SurrealDB internals.

3. **Helpful Guidance**: Field descriptions, placeholders, and error messages should provide helpful guidance to users, especially for more complex operations.

4. **Consistent Results**: Output should be formatted consistently across all operations, making it predictable and easy to work with.

5. **Reliability**: The node should handle edge cases gracefully and provide clear error messages when issues occur.

6. **Performance**: Operations should execute efficiently, with appropriate handling of large result sets and long-running queries.

By achieving these goals, the n8n-nodes-surrealdb project will provide a valuable tool for n8n users who want to leverage SurrealDB in their automation workflows.
