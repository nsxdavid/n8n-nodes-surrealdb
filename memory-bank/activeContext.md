# Active Context: n8n-nodes-surrealdb

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on refactoring the SurrealDB node to align with the requirements specified in the PRD. The node is functional to a point but needs significant work to properly align the operations and UI with expectations.

### Key Areas of Focus

1. **Resource-Based Organization**: Restructuring the node to organize functionality by resources (Record, Table, Query, System) as specified in the PRD.

2. **Operation Implementation**: Implementing all required operations for each resource, ensuring they follow the specifications in the PRD.

3. **Input Validation**: Enhancing input validation to provide better error messages and prevent invalid operations.

4. **Output Transformation**: Standardizing output formatting across all operations for consistency.

5. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling to provide more descriptive error messages.

## Recent Changes

1. **Refactoring Plan**: Created a comprehensive refactoring plan (PLAN.md) that outlines the steps to align the node with the PRD requirements.

2. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Set up the Memory Bank documentation structure to maintain project knowledge.

3. **Phase 1 Implementation**: Completed Phase 1 of the refactoring plan:
   - Added RecordId utility function (`createRecordId`)
   - Added input validation functions (`validateJSON`, `validateRequiredField`, `validateNumericField`, `validateArrayField`)
   - Added output transformation functions (`formatSingleResult`, `formatArrayResult`)

4. **Test Implementation**: Modified existing operations to test the new utility functions:
   - Updated the query operation to use `validateJSON`, `validateRequiredField`, and `formatSingleResult`/`formatArrayResult`
   - Added parameters support to the query operation
   - Updated the update operation to use `validateRequiredField` and `createRecordId`

5. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Removed unused imports and variables
   - Verified system operations (health check and version) functionality
   - Resolved all TypeScript compiler warnings

## Next Steps

According to the refactoring plan, the next steps are:

### Phase 1: Preparation and Infrastructure (Completed)

1. **Create RecordId Utility Function (Completed)**
   - Added a utility function to handle the creation of record ID strings
   - Implemented as `createRecordId(table, id)` in utilities.ts
   - Returns a string in the format "table:id"

2. **Enhance Input Validation (Completed)**
   - Added JSON validation function (`validateJSON`)
   - Added required field validation function (`validateRequiredField`)
   - Added numeric field validation function (`validateNumericField`)
   - Added array validation function (`validateArrayField`)
   - All validation functions implemented in GenericFunctions.ts

3. **Standardize Output Transformation (Completed)**
   - Added helper function for single result formatting (`formatSingleResult`)
   - Added helper function for array result formatting (`formatArrayResult`)
   - Both functions implemented in utilities.ts

### Phase 2: Resource-Based Restructuring (Completed)

4. **Implement Record Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Create operation (refactored existing create)
   - Added Get operation
   - Added Update operation (refactored existing update)
   - Added Merge operation
   - Added Delete operation (refactored existing delete)
   - Added Upsert operation
   - All operations implemented and working correctly

5. **Implement Table Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Get All Records operation (refactored existing select)
   - Added Create Many operation
   - Added Get Many operation
   - All operations implemented and working correctly

6. **Implement Query Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Refactored existing query operation
   - Added pagination support
   - Improved array result handling

7. **Implement System Resource Operations (Completed)**
   - Added Health Check operation using n8n's httpRequest helper
   - Added Version operation with fallback mechanism
   - Both operations implemented with proper error handling

### Phase 3: UI and UX Improvements (Next)

8. **Update Node Properties**
   - Review and refine the node properties
   - Enhance field descriptions and placeholders
   - Improve display options for better UX

9. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Review error handling across all operations
   - Add more descriptive error messages
   - Ensure consistent error handling patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Incremental Approach**: The refactoring will be done in small, incremental steps to minimize the risk of breaking existing functionality. Each step will be tested before moving on to the next.

2. **RecordId Handling**: The current implementation doesn't use the RecordId class from the SurrealDB SDK. We need to determine the correct approach for handling record IDs based on the SDK documentation.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: While refactoring, we need to ensure that existing functionality continues to work. This may require maintaining some backward compatibility code during the transition.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Each change will be tested to ensure it works correctly. We'll need to develop a testing strategy that covers all operations and edge cases.

5. **Documentation**: As we refactor, we'll need to update the documentation to reflect the new structure and functionality.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**: Keep related functionality together and use clear, descriptive names for functions and variables.

2. **Error Handling**: Use NodeOperationError with descriptive messages and include the item index where applicable.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs before performing operations to prevent errors and provide helpful feedback.

4. **Output Formatting**: Follow consistent output formatting patterns for all operations.

5. **Connection Management**: Establish connections at the beginning of execution and close them in a finally block to ensure cleanup.

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **SurrealDB SDK Usage**: The SurrealDB SDK provides a clean, intuitive API for interacting with SurrealDB. However, it requires proper handling of record IDs and connection management.

2. **n8n Node Development**: n8n provides a flexible framework for node development, but it requires careful attention to input/output formatting and error handling.

3. **Resource-Based Organization**: Organizing node functionality by resources provides a clear, intuitive structure for users and aligns with database concepts.

4. **Incremental Refactoring**: Breaking down a large refactoring task into small, incremental steps makes it more manageable and reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality.
