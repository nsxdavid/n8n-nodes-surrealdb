## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing the newly planned schema management operations for Tables, Fields, and Indexes, and the "Relations" resource operations, and continuing to enhance error handling across all operations.

### Key Areas of Focus

1. **Implement Schema Operations**: Adding the agreed-upon schema management operations:
   *   **Table Resource**: Create Table, Drop Table, List Tables, Describe Table, Create Field, Drop Field, List Fields, Describe Field
   *   **Index Resource**: Create Index, Drop Index, List Indexes, Describe Index

2. **Implement Relations Resource Operations**: Adding the planned operations for managing graph relationships:
    *   **Relations Resource**: Create Relationship, Delete Relationship, Select Relationships

3. **Enhance Error Handling**: Continuing to improve error handling to provide more descriptive error messages and consistent handling across all operations.

4. **Debugging and Logging**: Adding conditional debug logging to help troubleshoot query execution and result processing.

5. **Result Processing Improvements**: Enhancing the handling of query results, especially for queries with USE statements.

6. **Connection String Handling**: Improving connection string formatting to ensure proper /rpc endpoint handling.

## Recent Changes

1. **Refactoring Plan**: Created a comprehensive refactoring plan (PLAN.md) that outlines the steps to align the node with the PRD requirements.

2. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Set up the Memory Bank documentation structure to maintain project knowledge.

3. **Phase 1 Implementation**: Completed Phase 1 of the refactoring plan:
   - Added RecordId utility function (`createRecordId`)
   - Added input validation functions (`validateJSON`, `validateRequiredField`, `validateNumericField`, `validateArrayField`)
   - Added output transformation functions (`formatSingleResult`, `formatArrayResult`)

4. **Test Implementation**: Modified existing operations to test the new utility functions:
   - Updated the query operation to use `validateJSON`, `validateRequiredField`, and `formatSingleResult`/`formatArrayResult`
   - Added parameters support to the query operation
   - Updated the update operation to use `validateRequiredField` and `createRecordId`

5. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Removed unused imports and variables
   - Verified system operations (health check and version) functionality
   - Resolved all TypeScript compiler warnings
6. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Debugged and fixed the `getAllRecords` operation to correctly process results from `client.query`.
   - Debugged and fixed the `createMany` operation to use `client.insert()` instead of an incorrect `client.query()` call.
   - Debugged and fixed the `getMany` operation, confirming that interpolating Record IDs directly into the `WHERE id IN [...]` clause is the correct approach.
7. **Testing**: Confirmed `getAllRecords`, `createMany`, `getMany`, `executeQuery`, and `version` operations are working correctly after fixes.
8. **Namespace/Database Overrides**: Implemented optional Namespace and Database overrides: Added UI fields ("Namespace", "Database") in `SurrealDbProperties.ts`, retrieved values in `SurrealDb.node.ts`, and updated `validateAndResolveSurrealCredentials` in `GenericFunctions.ts` to prioritize overrides. Moved the "Advanced Options" block containing these fields to the end of the node properties list for better UI layout.

9. **UI Improvements - Options Consolidation**: Consolidated "Options" and "Advanced Options" into a single dropdown for a cleaner UI:
   - Removed the standalone "Advanced Options" collection
   - Added namespace/database fields to each resource-specific "Options" collection
   - Created new "Options" collections for resources that didn't have them (Record, System, and Table operations)
   - Updated `SurrealDb.node.ts` to retrieve namespace/database overrides from the consolidated "Options" parameter
   - This change simplifies the UI by reducing the number of dropdowns while maintaining all functionality

10. **Field Description Improvements**: Updated the descriptions for Table and Record ID fields to accurately reflect how the table extraction from record IDs works:
   - Clarified that the table prefix in a record ID (e.g., "person:john") is only used if the Table field is empty, rather than overriding it
   - Made it clear that any table field can accept a full record ID format (e.g., "person:john") and the table part will be automatically extracted
   - Verified that the implementations in the code match these descriptions

11. **Schema Operations Planning**: Planned the inclusion of new schema management operations for Tables, Fields, and Indexes, organized into their respective resources. Scopes are postponed for a later phase.

12. **Relations Resource Planning**: Planned the inclusion of a new "Relations" resource with operations for creating, deleting, and selecting graph relationships.

## Next Steps

The next steps are to implement the planned schema management and relations operations, and continue enhancing error handling:

1.  **Implement Table Schema Operations**:
    *   `Create Table`
    *   `Drop Table`
    *   `List Tables`
    *   `Describe Table`
    *   `Create Field`
    *   `Drop Field`
    *   `List Fields`
    *   `Describe Field`

2.  **Implement Index Resource and Operations**:
    *   Create the new "Index" resource definition.
    *   Implement `Create Index` operation.
    *   Implement `Drop Index` operation.
    *   Implement `List Indexes` operation.
    *   Implement `Describe Index` operation.

3.  **Implement Relations Resource and Operations**:
    *   Create the new "Relations" resource definition.
    *   Implement `Create Relationship` operation.
    *   Implement `Delete Relationship` operation.
    *   Implement `Select Relationships` operation.

4.  **Continue Error Handling Enhancements**: Review and improve error messages and consistency across all operations.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Incremental Approach**: The refactoring will be done in small, incremental steps to minimize the risk of breaking existing functionality. Each step will be tested before moving on to the next.

2. **Credentials Implementation**: The credentials have been rewritten to simplify the connection options to HTTP/HTTPS only and enable standard n8n credential testing. This approach:
   - Simplifies the code and reduces potential issues
   - Aligns with n8n credential testing standards
   - Provides a more robust connection testing mechanism
   - Makes the code easier to maintain and update

3. **RecordId Handling**: The current implementation uses string concatenation for record IDs rather than the RecordId class from the SurrealDB SDK. We need to determine the correct approach for handling record IDs based on the SDK documentation.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: While refactoring, we need to ensure that existing functionality continues to work. This may require maintaining some backward compatibility code during the transition.

5. **Testing Strategy**: Each change will be tested to ensure it works correctly. We'll need to develop a testing strategy that covers all operations and edge cases.

6. **Documentation**: As we refactor, we'll need to update the documentation to reflect the new structure and functionality.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**: Keep related functionality together and use clear, descriptive names for functions and variables.

2. **Error Handling**: Use NodeOperationError with descriptive messages and include the item index where applicable.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs before performing operations to prevent errors and provide helpful feedback.

4. **Output Formatting**: Follow consistent output formatting patterns for all operations.

5. **Connection Management**: Establish connections at the beginning of execution and close them in a finally block to ensure cleanup.
6. **`client.query` Result Processing**: When processing results from `client.query` for a single `SELECT` statement, check `Array.isArray(result) && result.length > 0 && Array.isArray(result[0])` and access the records via `result[0]`. Use appropriate generic types (e.g., `<[any[]]>`) with `client.query` to ensure type safety.
7. **`WHERE id IN [...]` Queries**: When using `client.query` with a `WHERE id IN [...]` clause, interpolating the list of full Record IDs directly into the query string (e.g., `WHERE id IN [table:id1,table:id2]`) is necessary. Parameterizing the array of IDs (e.g., `WHERE id IN $ids`) does not seem to work correctly with the current SDK version/behavior.

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **SurrealDB SDK Usage**: The SurrealDB SDK provides a clean, intuitive API for interacting with SurrealDB. However, it requires proper handling of record IDs and connection management.
   - The `client.query` method returns an array of results, one for each statement. For a single `SELECT` statement, the result is an array containing one element, which is the array of records (e.g., `result[0]` contains the records). Providing a generic type like `<[any[]]>` helps TypeScript understand this structure.
   - The `client.insert()` method correctly handles inserting an array of records for bulk creation.
   - Parameterizing arrays of Record IDs for `WHERE id IN $ids` clauses in `client.query` does not seem to work; direct interpolation of the Record ID list into the query string is required for this specific case.

2. **n8n Node Development**: n8n provides a flexible framework for node development, but it requires careful attention to input/output formatting and error handling.

3. **Resource-Based Organization**: Organizing node functionality by resources provides a clear, intuitive structure for users and aligns with database concepts.

4. **Incremental Refactoring**: Breaking down a large refactoring task into small, incremental steps makes it more manageable and reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality.
